# Enhancements

The [enhancements repository](https://github.com/jenkins-x/enhancements) contains design proposals for [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/) enhancements.

All proposals are welcome, please follow this process:

- Raise an issue on this repo describing at high level what the enhancement looks to achieve and whether you would like any help with the proposal.
- If you would like some early collaboration from the Jenkins X community you might want to start with Google Docs for a faster feedback cycle.
- Open a pull request containing markdown giving some context, describing the problem the enhancement aims to solve along with possible solutions.
